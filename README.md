## Why I chose Digital Technology
I chose digital technology because im interested in learning about python, javascript, game development and 3d modelling and just programming/coding in general. I believe since practically everyone uses the internet now on a daily basis why not have a headstart by learning more about how it works and how your favorite game or website was created.
